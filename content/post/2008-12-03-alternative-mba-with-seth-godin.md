Look this trade-off: Instead of getting a MBA, spend 6 months at the office of one of the greatest marketing authors and blogger.

That&#8217;s what <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a> is <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/Alternative-MBA" target="_blank">offering</a>. Quoting him, what he offers is:

> Six intense months working with a few other amazing people (and me.)

It is a really awesome opportunity for one who already lives or can afford the expenses of living 6 months in NYC.

It is not everyday that one <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">have</span> has the chance to get 6 months of coaching and learning from someone like Seth, and for **free**.
