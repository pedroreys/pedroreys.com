I have a Dell Studio XPS 1640 running Windows 7 Home Premium x64. 

Yesterday it crashed (sigh) and when I rebooted the check disk was triggered. To my, not pleasant, surprise, Check Disk hanged at 1 sec left on the countdown for pressing a key to skip the disk check. Doing a hard reboot several times I was able to start windows again.

Well, after some googling I found the [HOTFIX KB 975778](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975778) that solved the issue like a charm for me.
